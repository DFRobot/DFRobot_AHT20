 * @file DFRobot_AHT20.h
 * @brief This AHT20 temperature & humidity sensor employs digital output and I2C interface, through which users can read the measured temperature and humidity. Based on the AHT20 chip, it offers the following features:
 * @n 1. Collect ambient temperature, unit Celsius (℃), range -40-85℃, resolution: 0.01, error: ±0.3-±1.6℃
 * @n 2. Collect ambient relative humidity, unit: %RH, range 0-100%RH, resolution 0.024%RH, error: when the temprature is 25℃, error range is ±2-±5%RH
 * @n 3. Use I2C interface, I2C address is default to be 0x38
 * @n 4. uA level sensor, the measuring current supply is less than 200uA.
 * @n 5. Power supply range 3.3-5V
